# Data Engineering CoP Paired Programming Tasks
Welcome to the repository for paired programming tasks from the Data Engineering Community of Practice (CoP). This repository contains a collection of programming exercises completed during our CoP sessions. Each folder is named after the date the CoP occurred and contains the associated tasks.

## Tasks completed so far
- 06062024_pg_locks_and_space_invaders: Contains exercises related to PostgreSQL locks and a Space Invaders game implementation.
- 18072024_G7_whiskey_interview_task: Contains the G7 interview task in regards to the GDP of whiskey completed during the CoP session.
