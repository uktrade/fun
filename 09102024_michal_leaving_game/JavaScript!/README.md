## ðŸš€ Your Tasks

### 1. **Make it Less Hard to Play**
   - The current difficulty level might be a bit challenging for some players. Your task is to adjust the game's mechanics to make it easier to play. This could include tweaking the jump height, reducing the speed of obstacles, or adjusting gravity.

### 2. **Add a Scoreboard**
   - Implement a scoreboard that tracks how many obstacles Michal successfully jumps over. This will add an extra layer of challenge and motivation for players to keep improving their score.

### 3. **Improve Obstacle Layout**
   - The obstacles currently don't align perfectly, which can make the game feel less polished. Your task is to improve the layout so that all obstacles are neatly in line, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

### 4. **Enhance the Game Over UI**
   - The current game over message is quite basic. We want to make it more interactive and visually appealing. Consider adding animations, buttons to restart the game, or even a fun message to encourage players to try again.

### 5. **Add Console Logging**
   - For debugging and development purposes, implement console logging throughout the game. This could include logging when a player jumps, when they collide with an obstacle, or when they successfully dodge an obstacle.
